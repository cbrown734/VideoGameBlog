        <h2>LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga Review</h2><br>
          <p>
            LEGO® Star Wars™: The Complete Saga is a Lego-themed action and adventure game that released back in 2007. For many people like myself, this game became a staple game in their childhood that provokes a lot of emotions and memories of what it was like when they were a child.

            This game is a combination of Lego Star Wars: The Video Game which was released in 2005 and Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy which was released in 2006. In The Complete Saga, the player plays through the first six episodes in the Star Wars movies. For each movie, there are six unique and action-packed levels. The game also has 20 bounty hunter missions and 6 bonus stages. Some levels have the player running around collecting coins, red/gold bricks, and minikits, while some levels put the player in the cockpit of an X-wing, Pod racer, or another type of vehicle. Another cool part of this game is unlocking all of the characters, vehicles, and extras by purchasing them through the shop in the cantina. With these purchased characters and vehicles you can go back and play levels in free play mode allowing you to complete any level with any character, this adds to the replayability factor of the game.

            Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has never played it before. I would consider this game to be one of the best Lego games and if you like any of the other Lego games then you will not be disappointed with this game. In Q2 of this game Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is set to release and it recreates/remasters the first six episodes of the Star Wars franchise along with the more recent films in the Star Wars universe. I would highly recommend a playthrough of The Complete Saga to get you ready for the new game set to release later this year.
