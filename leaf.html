      <h2>Leaf Blower Revolution Review</h2><br>

          <p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a game that I recently found through the Steam store. This game is what is known as an idle game or an incremental game, the purpose behind these games is that they are meant to be run in the background or progress will be made next time the user opens the game. <br><br>

In this game, as the name implies the player blows leaves. As time goes on and as more leaves are blown the player can upgrade the tool that they use to blow the leaves and adventure to new areas where they can discover and blow new types of leaves. The more leaves you blow, the more upgrades you can acquire. The player can get things live robots similar to Roombas’ that help blow leaves all the way to leaf converters that help convert one type of leave into a more valuable leaf. While this game seems silly it can quickly become something that you can quickly get lost in. I find playing this game to be quite relaxing and therapeutic as the nice music and atmosphere helps keep your mind off things. Over the course of the past week and a half, I have already played this game for 25 hours! If you are looking for a fun game that is free and that can be played while doing something else like doing schoolwork or watching TV I would highly you give this game a shot. <br>

If you would like to give the game a try you can find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1468260/Leaf_Blower_Revolution__Idle_Game/">here</a><br><br>
