            <h2>Leaf Blower Revolution Review</h2><br>
            <p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a game that I recently found through the Steam store. This game is what is known as an idle game or an incremental game, the purpose behind these games is that they are meant to be run in the background or progress will be made next time the user opens the game.<p><br>

            <p>In this game, as the name implies the player blows leaves. As time goes on and as more leaves are blown the player can upgrade the tool that they use to blow the leaves and adventure to new areas where they can discover and blow new types of leaves. The more leaves you blow, the more upgrades you can acquire...</p> <br><br>

            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Halo_3_final_boxshot.JPG" align="right">
            <p>
              Halo 3's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite Flood. The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood...

            <h2>Pros of the Game</h2>
            <p>
              This game has elite map selection and attention to detail. The multiplayer is as addicting as any other game like it. Halo 3 delivered the best overall representation of the Halo experience: an epic campaign with high production values;  fluid first-person shooter gameplay; a deep and robust online experience...

            <h2>Spelunky Review</h2><br><br>
              <p>Spelunky is a roguelike/platformer game created by Derek Yu in the year 2008. Over the course of the next few years the game gained popularity and traction and because of this Yu decided to create an HD remake of the game in 2013, and in September of 2020, Spelunky 2 was released for a number of different devices including PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch! Spelunky 2 builds on Spelunky and adds new characters, enemies, items, and online play among other things.</p><br><br>

              <p>In Spelunky, the player is put into a randomly generated cave, and they are tasked with the goal of going further and further into the cave. As you progress into the cave you will discover different enemies, items to help you survive, and more biomes...</p><br><br>
