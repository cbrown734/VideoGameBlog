            <a href="leaf.html"><h2>Leaf Blower Revolution Review</h2></a><br>
            <p>Leaf Blower Revolution is a game that I recently found through the Steam store. This game is what is known as an idle game or an incremental game, the purpose behind these games is that they are meant to be run in the background or progress will be made next time the user opens the game. <br><br>

    In this game, as the name implies the player blows leaves. As time goes on and as more leaves are blown the player can upgrade the tool that they use to blow the leaves and adventure to new areas where they can discover and blow new types of leaves. The more leaves you blow, the more upgrades you can acquire. The player can get things live robots similar to Roombas’ that help blow leaves all the way to leaf converters that help convert one type of leave into a more valuable leaf. While this game seems silly it can quickly become something that you can quickly get lost in. I find playing this game to be quite relaxing and therapeutic as the nice music and atmosphere helps keep your mind off things. Over the course of the past week and a half, I have already played this game for 25 hours! If you are looking for a fun game that is free and that can be played while doing something else like doing schoolwork or watching TV I would highly you give this game a shot. <br><br>

If you would like to give the game a try you can find it

            <h2>Halo 3 Review</h2><br><br>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Halo_3_final_boxshot.JPG" align="right">
            <p>
              Halo 3's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite Flood. The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood..
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Pros of the Game</h2><br>
            <p>
              This game has elite map selection and attention to detail. The multiplayer is as addicting as any other game like it. Halo 3 delivered the best overall representation of the Halo experience: an epic campaign with high production values;  fluid first-person shooter gameplay; a deep and robust online experience.
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Overall Review</h2><br>
            <p>
              As someone who has been a Halo fan since the original Xbox years, I’ll always have a vested interest in the series and will check out each new installment as they’re released. That being said, even I recognize that the franchise has diminished in terms of popularity and overall significance over the last decade. While it’s possible that the franchise will rebound and recapture some of its former glory, it’s hard to imagine that the series will ever again return to being as relevant as it was when Halo 3 was first released. The game was not only a critical and commercial success but taken as a whole, it still stands as the pinnacle of the series..

            <h2>Spelunky Review</h2><br><br>
              <p>Spelunky is a roguelike/platformer game created by Derek Yu in the year 2008. Over the course of the next few years the game gained popularity and traction and because of this Yu decided to create an HD remake of the game in 2013. In September of 2020, Spelunky 2 was released for a number of different devices including PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.
</p><br><br>

              <p>In Spelunky, the player is put into a randomly generated cave, and they are tasked with the goal of going further and further into the cave. As you progress into the cave you will discover different enemies, items to help you survive, and more biomes. Eventually, the player will reach the end of the cave where they have to kill the final boss. Spelunky is a very unique and challenging game, the more you play the more you learn about how to survive, what to avoid, etc.. Spelunky is great because it has a ton of replayability value due to its randomness and difficulty. Spelunky also has a great multiplayer that allows you to play the normal mode with friends or play a deathmatch mode in which you are put in an arena and pitted against your friends. Overall I would highly recommend this game as it is a game that I have been coming back to for many years.
</p><br><br>

              <p>I would highly recommend that you give any version of this game a try. <br> Spelunky Classic can be downloaded for free <a href="https://spelunkyworld.com/original.html">here</a><br>Spelunky 2 can be found on many differnet platforms such as PC, Xbox, PS vita, and PS3<br>Lastly Spelunky 2 can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4407-CUSA20601_00-SPELUNKY20000000">PS4</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/spelunky-2-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a></p><br><br>
