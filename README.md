      <h2>Game Overview</h2>
      <p>Halo 3's story centers on the interstellar war between twenty-sixth century humanity, a collection of alien races known as the Covenant, and the alien parasite Flood. The player assumes the role of the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier, as he battles the Covenant and the Flood..</p>
      <h2>Pros of the Game</h2>
      <p>This game has elite map selection and attention to detail. The multiplayer is as addicting as any other game like it. Halo 3 delivered the best overall representation of the Halo experience: an epic campaign with high production values;  fluid first-person shooter gameplay; a deep and robust online experience.</p>

      <h3>Overall Review</h3>
      <p>As someone who has been a Halo fan since the original Xbox years, I’ll always have a vested interest in the series and will check out each new installment as they’re released. That being said, even I recognize that the franchise has diminished in terms of popularity and overall significance over the last decade. While it’s possible that the franchise will rebound and recapture some of its former glory, it’s hard to imagine that the series will ever again return to being as relevant as it was when Halo 3 was first released. The game was not only a critical and commercial success but taken as a whole, it still stands as the pinnacle of the series..</p>
