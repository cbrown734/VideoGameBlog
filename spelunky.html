        <h2>Spelunky Review</h2><br><br>
        <p>Spelunky is a roguelike/platformer game created by Derek Yu in the year 2008. Over the course of the next few years the game gained popularity and traction and because of this Yu decided to create an HD remake of the game in 2013. In September of 2020, Spelunky 2 was released for a number of different devices including PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.

        <p>In Spelunky, the player is put into a randomly generated cave, and they are tasked with the goal of going further and further into the cave. As you progress into the cave you will discover different enemies, items to help you survive, and more biomes. Eventually, the player will reach the end of the cave where they have to kill the final boss. Spelunky is a very unique and challenging game, the more you play the more you learn about how to survive, what to avoid, etc.. Spelunky is great because it has a ton of replayability value due to its randomness and difficulty. Spelunky also has a great multiplayer that allows you to play the normal mode with friends or play a deathmatch mode in which you are put in an arena and pitted against your friends. Overall I would highly recommend this game as it is a game that I have been coming back to for many years.
