        <h2>Kirby & the Amazing Mirror Review</h2><br>
          <p>
            Kirby & the Amazing Mirror is an action platformer game that has a very unique and fun implementation of local co-op multiplayer. It was released by Nintendo in 2004 for the Gameboy Advance and is what a lot of people consider to be one of the greatest Kirby games to be released to date.

             In this game, Kirby is tasked with gathering the shards of the amazing mirror that has been scattered all across Mirror Land. Just like the mirror Kirby also gets split, however, he is split into four different unique Kirbys. The Kirbys must work together to gather all of the pieces of the mirror back. This is accomplished with the help of other NPC Kirbys or your friends that you can play with through the use of the link cable. The combat in the game is super fun as there is a ton of different powers and abilities that you can copy from the various differnet enemies that you encounter throughout the world. There are also many different minigames that can be play individually and together with friends.

            When playing this game singleplayer the player controls one of the Kirbys and adventures across the world attempting to gather the pieces of the mirror. Multiplayer allows four people to play at the same time. Each player can go traverse through the world on their own accord and progress through the storey. Whenever a player needs assistance with something they can use their cell phone to call their friends or NPC Kirbys to aid them with a fight or help heal eachother. This ability for each player to go off and adventure on their own is something that is not very common in videogames and to this day is somewhat of a breath of fresh air.
